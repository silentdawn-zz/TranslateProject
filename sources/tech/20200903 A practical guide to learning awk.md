A practical guide to learning awk

Of all the [Linux][2] commands out there (and there are many), the three most quintessential seem to be `sed`, `awk`, and `grep`. Maybe it's the arcane sound of their names, or the breadth of their potential use, or just their age, but when someone's giving an example of a "Linuxy" command, it's usually one of those three. And while `sed` and `grep` have several simple one-line standards, the less prestigious `awk` remains persistently prominent for being particularly puzzling.

You're likely to use `sed` for a quick string replacement or `grep` to filter for a pattern on a daily basis. You're far less likely to compose an `awk` command. I often wonder why this is, and I attribute it to a few things. First of all, many of us barely use `sed` and `grep` for anything but some variation upon these two commands:


```
$ sed -e 's/foo/bar/g' file.txt
$ grep foo file.txt
```

So, even though you might feel more comfortable with `sed` and `grep`, you may not use their full potential. Of course, there's no obligation to learn more about `sed` or `grep`, but I sometimes wonder about the way I "learn" commands. Instead of learning _how_ a command works, I often learn a specific incantation that includes a command. As a result, I often feel a false familiarity with the command. I think I know a command because I can name three or four options off the top of my head, even though I don't know what the options do and can't quite put my finger on the syntax.

And that's the problem, I believe, that many people face when confronted with the power and flexibility of `awk`.

### Learning awk to use awk

The basics of `awk` are surprisingly simple. It's often noted that `awk` is a programming language, and although it's a relatively basic one, it's true. This means you can learn `awk` the same way you learn a new coding language: learn its syntax using some basic commands, learn its vocabulary so you can build up to complex actions, and then practice, practice, practice.

### How awk parses input

`Awk` sees input, essentially, as an array. When `awk` scans over a text file, it treats each line, individually and in succession, as a _record_. Each record is broken into _fields_. Of course, `awk` must keep track of this information, and you can see that data using the `NR` (number of records) and `NF` (number of fields) built-in variables. For example, this gives you the line count of a file:


```
$ awk 'END { print NR;}' example.txt
36
```

This also reveals something about `awk` syntax. Whether you're writing `awk` as a one-liner or as a self-contained script, the structure of an `awk` instruction is:


```
`pattern or keyword { actions }`
```

In this example, the word `END` is a special, reserved keyword rather than a pattern. A similar keyword is `BEGIN`. With both of these keywords, `awk` just executes the action in braces at the start or end of parsing data.

You can use a _pattern_ as a filter or qualifier so that `awk` only executes a given action when it is able to match your pattern to the current record. For instance, suppose you want to use `awk`, much as you would `grep`, to find the word _Linux_ in a file of text:


```
$ awk '/Linux/ { print $0; }' os.txt
OS: CentOS Linux (10.1.1.8)
OS: CentOS Linux (10.1.1.9)
OS: Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) (10.1.1.11)
OS: Elementary Linux (10.1.2.4)
OS: Elementary Linux (10.1.2.5)
OS: Elementary Linux (10.1.2.6)
```

For `awk`, each line in the file is a record, and each word in a record is a field. By default, fields are separated by a space. You can change that with the `--field-separator` option, which sets the `FS` (field separator) variable to whatever you want it to be:


```
$ awk --field-separator ':' '/Linux/ { print $2; }' os.txt
 CentOS Linux (10.1.1.8)
 CentOS Linux (10.1.1.9)
 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) (10.1.1.11)
 Elementary Linux (10.1.2.4)
 Elementary Linux (10.1.2.5)
 Elementary Linux (10.1.2.6)
```

In this sample, there's an empty space before each listing because there's a blank space after each colon (`:`) in the source text. This isn't `cut`, though, so the field separator needn't be limited to one character:


```
$ awk --field-separator ': ' '/Linux/ { print $2; }' os.txt
CentOS Linux (10.1.1.8)
CentOS Linux (10.1.1.9)
Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) (10.1.1.11)
Elementary Linux (10.1.2.4)
Elementary Linux (10.1.2.5)
Elementary Linux (10.1.2.6)
```

### Functions in awk

You can build your own functions in `awk` using this syntax:


```
`name(parameters) { actions }`
```

Functions are important because they allow you to write code once and reuse it throughout your work. When constructing one-liners, custom functions are a little less useful than they are in scripts, but `awk` defines many functions for you already. They work basically the same as any function in any other language or spreadsheet: You learn the order that the function needs information from you, and you can feed it whatever you want to get the results.

There are functions to perform mathematical operations and string processing. The math ones are often fairly straightforward. You provide a number, and it crunches it:


```
$ awk 'BEGIN { print sqrt(1764); }'
42
```

String functions can be more complex but are well documented in the [GNU awk manual][3]. For example, the `split` function takes an entity that `awk` views as a single field and splits it into different parts. It requires a field, a variable to use as an array containing each part of the split, and the character you want to use as the delimiter.

Using the output of the previous examples, I know that there's an IP address at the very end of each record. In this case, I can send just the last field of a record to the `split` function by referencing the variable `NF` because it contains the number of fields (and the final field must be the highest number):


```
$ awk --field-separator ': ' '/Linux/ { split($NF, IP, "."); print "subnet: " IP[3]; }' os.txt
subnet: 1
subnet: 1
subnet: 1
subnet: 2
subnet: 2
subnet: 2
```

There are many more functions, and there's no reason to limit yourself to one per block of `awk` code. You can construct complex pipelines with `awk` in your terminal, or you can write `awk` scripts to define and utilize your own functions.

### Download the eBook

Learning `awk` is mostly a matter of using `awk`. Use it even if it means duplicating functionality you already have with `sed` or `grep` or `cut` or `tr` or any other perfectly valid commands. Once you get comfortable with it, you can write Bash functions that invoke your custom `awk` commands for easier use. And eventually, you'll be able to write scripts to parse complex datasets.
